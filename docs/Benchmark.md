### Micro benchmark
#### Micro Benchmark is a benchmark designed to measure the performance of a very small and specific piece of code.

### Benefits
* Stop performance degradation of critical path in your code for current and future releases.
* Select  most performant option for your solution.

### JMH - Java Microbenchmark Harness
#### JMH takes care of the things like JVM warm-up and code-optimization paths, making benchmarking as simple as possible. JDK team use JMH to benchmark JDK code.

### Agenda
